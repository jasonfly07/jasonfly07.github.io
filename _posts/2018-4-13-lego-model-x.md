Due to work, I got to drive Model X from time to time. It really is an awesome car, and I've grown to love it. Sadly, I can't really afford one, so I decide to build one myself. With Lego.

### Parts

I digged out my Lego box under the bed; it was obvious there weren't even enough parts to make a front door. So I bought a set that seems to have lots of car-relevant parts:

### Keeping things organized

Since the truck set was predominantly gray, I decided to use gray as the main color of Model X. This means all the white & green liftarms are useless to me. On the other hand, there were ~2600 pieces in this set, so I put those liftarms to good use & kept some of the bigger pieces organized:

### Chassis

There are lots of flat pieces; seems straightforward to use them as the chassis.

A bigger challenge is getting the scale right. Since all the wheel are of the same size, I used them to scale every other part. I ended up doing this a lot to make sure I didn't deviate too far from the correct scale:

It also helped to build some kind of scaffolding for the entire car, since at this point, I was doubtful that I could build a realistic Model X with existing parts. It was reassuring to see the shape that captures the essense of it.

### Hood & seats

Fortunately, the truck set has a few curved pieces that looks surprisingly similar to the hood.

There were special pieces from the set for building nice-looking car seats, but there were only enough parts for 2, and I needed at least 6, so I had to stick to standard pieces. I tried my best to re-create the subtle curves & contour of a seat with rigid pieces. This later underwent several iterations.

### Falcon wing door

This is a big problem, since falcon wing doors & their frames are tilted, and it's usually not easy to assemble Lego pieces that are not perpendicular to one another; you need extra parts to constrain their movement. The first version of door frame was flimsy as hell:

It took a lot of support pieces to keep everything steady, but then it looked like a mess:

The doors are equally tricky to get the shape correct; the pieces barely fit together in this one:

But it's still nice to see the falcon wing coming to life!
