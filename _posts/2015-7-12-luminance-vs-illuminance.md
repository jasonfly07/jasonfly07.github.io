What's the difference between **luminance** and **Illuminance**?  

Which unit should I use to describe the brightness of my light bulb? **Lumen**, **Candela**, or **Lux**?  

If you find yourself ask these questions, this article is for you. The following provides a summary of these [confusing terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela#SI_photometric_light_units). 
In short, there're really only **4 quantities** (and their accompanying units) that you need to know, and we'll go through them one by one.  

Let's start with a lamp. (and a cat)  

###1. Luminous Flux

When you buy a light bulb, the first (and probably the only) thing you want to know is *how much light comes out of the light bulb*. This is expressed with **luminous flux** (or luminous power), which measures **the total amount of power of visible light emitted from the light source**.     
The unit is **lumen**.  

###2. Luminous Intensity

Ok, so now we know how much light the lamp emits in total, but what if we just want to know *how much light it's emitting at a particular direction*? This can be represented with **luminous intensity**, which is simply **luminous flux over a unit solid angle**.  

The unit is lumen/sr, or **candela**.  

###3. Illuminance
